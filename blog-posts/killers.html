            <h2>Costco for Serial Killers</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2023-11-26">November 26, 2023</time></p>
            <div class="summary">How to save money to afford a better legal defense.</div>
            <p>In today's world, being a serial killer is no cheap affair, and let's face it, the cost of a solid legal
                defense is enough to make even the most hardened criminal think twice. But fear not, my budget-conscious
                villainous friends, for I have discovered the Costco for Serial Killers—a one-stop shop to help you save
                those precious dollars for when you really need them.</p>
            <p>First and foremost, let’s talk about DIY forensic cleanup kits. Why splurge on professional services when
                you can get everything you need in a bundle? From industrial-strength bleach to those nifty UV lights
                (to make sure you haven't missed a spot), Costco offers an all-in-one solution. Plus, buying in bulk
                always saves money!</p>
            <p>Next up, disguises. We all know the importance of a good disguise, and Costco has you covered—literally.
                With a wide selection of hats, sunglasses, and fake mustaches, you can mix and match your look to avoid
                detection. And the best part? These come in packs of twelve, so you can have a new identity almost every
                month of the year.</p>
            <p>Transportation is key, and our favorite wholesale club hasn't forgotten this. While they might not sell
                cars, they do offer discounts on rental vehicles. Perfect for those who need to make a quick,
                inconspicuous getaway without leaving a trace back to their real identity. Remember, always use cash!
            </p>
            <p>But what about after the deed is done? Costco's selection of heavy-duty trash bags and shovels comes in
                handy. And if you're environmentally conscious, they even offer biodegradable options. Talk about being
                eco-friendly while disposing of... evidence.</p>
            <p>Of course, one must not forget sustenance. Serial killing is energy-intensive work, after all. Costco’s
                array of bulk snacks and energy drinks will keep you going during those long nights of... planning. And
                for those moments of introspection and guilt? Their bulk-sized liquor section is just what the doctor
                ordered (not really, please drink responsibly).</p>
            <p>Lastly, let's talk about saving for that all-important legal defense. Costco offers various financial
                services, including high-yield savings accounts. Start stashing away a part of your... err... 'earnings'
                into one of these accounts, and watch your defense fund grow.</p>
            <p>As Police Chief Jane Doe has noted:
            <blockquote>I find it both alarming and slightly amusing. We're used to tracking down criminals through
                sophisticated methods, but now we might just start checking Costco receipts. Crime
                doesn't pay, but if it did, it seems you'd get a bulk discount.</blockquote>
