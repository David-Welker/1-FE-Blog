            <h2>Estate Planning for Burglars</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2023-11-25">November 25, 2023</time></p>
            <div class="summary">How to protect your loot for future generations.</div>
            <p>When you’ve spent a lifetime perfecting the art of burglary, the last thing you want is for your
                hard-earned loot to end up in the wrong hands. That's where estate planning comes in – because even
                burglars care about their legacy.</p>
            <p>First things first, let’s talk about hiding spots. Forget under the mattress or burying it in the
                backyard. Those are amateur moves. We’re talking about sophisticated, high-tech solutions. Think along
                the lines of a painting with eyes that follow you around the room, but behind those eyes? A
                state-of-the-art safe.</p>
            <p>Now, let's discuss the legalities. Of course, you can't just waltz into your lawyer's office with a bag
                of questionable jewels and ask for a will. No, you need a more... creative approach. Consider setting up
                a ‘front’ business. Maybe a quaint antique shop? Here, your illicit gains can be 'found' items, passed
                down from generation to generation. It's not just money laundering; it's family heritage laundering!</p>
            <p>Don't forget about digital assets. In this day and age, a savvy burglar goes beyond physical goods.
                Perhaps you've accumulated a substantial amount of cryptocurrency from those less-than-legal online
                marketplaces. Make sure your digital wallet passwords are included in your estate plans – encrypted, of
                course. We suggest a riddle only your descendants would understand, like "The place where I hid Aunt
                Edna's emerald necklace that one time."</p>
            <p>Finally, consider setting up a trust fund for your little burglars-in-training. Education is key, after
                all. They’ll need to learn the family trade, and what better way than through a fund specifically
                earmarked for lock-picking classes, alarm disabling seminars, and the occasional ethics course (purely
                for balance).</p>
            <p>As Police Chief Jane Doe has noted:
            <blockquote>I find it both alarming and slightly amusing. We're used to tracking down criminals through
                sophisticated methods, but now we might just start checking Costco receipts. Crime
                doesn't pay, but if it did, it seems you'd get a bulk discount.</blockquote>
