            <h2>Self-Defense for Carjackers</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2023-11-24">November 24, 2023</time></p>
            <div class="summary">How to make your victims seem like the aggressor.</div>
            <p>Attention all budding carjackers looking to add a twist to their trade! If you ever find yourself in the
                precarious position of being caught in the act, worry not. There's a tried-and-true tactic that just
                might save your skin: frame the actual owner. Yes, it's as bold as it sounds, but in the world of crime,
                sometimes bold is the only way to go.</p>
            <p>Here's how you do it: as soon as you're caught, immediately switch to defense mode. Point an accusing
                finger at the real owner and proclaim, "Stop, thief!" The key here is conviction. You've got to sell it.
                Accuse them of trying to steal their own car. Throw in some theatrics – panic, shock, moral outrage.
                Remember, you're not just a carjacker now; you're an actor on the stage of deceit.</p>
            <p>Next, dial up the drama. Start narrating a fabricated story of how you heroically intervened to stop this
                'villainous car thief.' Describe your brave confrontation, how you wrestled with your conscience before
                leaping into action. The more elaborate the story, the better. If you're going to frame someone, you
                might as well make it a spectacle.</p>
            <p>Of course, this strategy requires quick thinking and a certain disregard for the truth. But in the
                carjacking business, those are probably skills you've honed already. Just remember, if you're going to
                commit to this ruse, commit fully. Half-measures won't do in the art of framing the innocent.</p>
            <p>As Police Chief Jane Doe has noted:
            <blockquote>It's fascinating to observe how quickly people jump to conclusions. These days, someone tries
                to help you with your car, maybe even ensure you're taking proper care of it, and suddenly they're
                treated with suspicion. We've had a few cases where these good Samaritans were mistaken for having less
                noble intentions. It's a strange world – no good deed goes unquestioned, it seems!</blockquote>
